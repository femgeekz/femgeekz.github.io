I was just wondering, if there was a pressing need for us to adopt a new wide range of programming languages, just to obtain a few benefits!? I was eyeing on functional aspects of programming though!

But then, here is my opinion :
Its always good to know different languages and the programming style, but it is equally important to evolve and go hand in hand, with the language at hand. 
If the language doesn't evolve as per our demands, we know what's the last resort!

With Java, its not the case - its actively evolving!
So, I have decided to stay with it for a while and be a part of its evolution!

Did you move on?

Happy Evolving! :)
